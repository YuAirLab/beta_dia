# Beta-DIA

Beta-DIA is a partially open-source, free-to-use Python software that provides comprehensive peptide/protein identification and accurate quantification results for single-shot diaPASEF data.

### Installation

We recommend using [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to create a Python environment for using Beta-DIA, whether on Windows or Linux.

1. Create a Python environment with version 3.9.18.
    ```bash
    conda create -n beta_env python=3.9.18, numpy<2.0.0
    conda activate beta_env
    ```

2. Install the corresponding PyTorch and CuPy packages based on your CUDA version (which can be checked using the `nvidia-smi` command). Beta-DIA will fail on computers without a GPU.
  - CUDA-12
    ```bash
    pip install torch==2.3.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
    pip install cupy-cuda12x
    conda install cudatoolkit
    ```
  - CUDA-11
    ```bash
    pip install torch==2.3.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    pip install cupy-cuda11x
    conda install cudatoolkit
    ```

3. Install Beta-DIA
    ```bash
    pip install beta_dia
    ```

### Usage
```bash
beta_dia -lib "Absolute path of the spectral library" -ws "Absolute path of the .d folder or a folder containing multiple .d folders"
```
(Please note that the path needs to be enclosed in quotes.)

- `-lib`<br>
This parameter is used to specify the absolute path of the spectral library.
Beta-DIA currently supports the spectral library with the suffix .speclib predicted by DIA-NN (>=v1.9). 
It supports oxygen modifications on methionine (M) but does not include modifications such as phosphorylation or acetylation. 
Refer to [this](https://github.com/vdemichev/DiaNN) for instructions on how to generate prediction spectral libraries using DIA-NN. 
Beta-DIA will develop its own predictor capable of forecasting the peptide retention time, ion mobility, and fragmentation pattern. 
It may also be compatible with other formats of spectral libraries based on requests.

- `-ws`<br>
This parameter is used to specify the .d folder or the folder containing multiple .d folders that need to be analyzed.

### Output
Beta-DIA will generate **`beta_dia/report_beta.log.txt`** and **`beta_dia/report_beta.tsv`** in each .d folder. 
The report_beta.tsv contains precursor and protein IDs, as well as plenty of associated information. 
Most column names are consistent with DIA-NN and are self-explanatory.

* **Protein.Group** - inferred proteins. Beta-DIA uses [IDPicker](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr070230d) algorithm to infer proteins. 
* **Protein.Ids** - all proteins matched to the precursor in the library.
* **Protein.Names** names (UniProt names) of the proteins in the Protein.Group.
* **PG.Quantity** quantity of the Protein.Group.
* **Precursor.Id** peptide seq + precursor charge.
* **Precursor.Charge** the charge of precursor.
* **Q.Value** run-specific precursor q-value.
* **Protein.Q.Value** run-specific q-value for the unique protein, that is protein identified with proteotypic (=specific to it) peptides.
* **PG.Q.Value** run-specific q-value for the protein group.
* **Proteotypic** indicates the peptide is specific to a protein.
* **Precursor.Quantity** quantity of the precursor.
* **RT** the retention time of the precursor.
* **IM** the ion mobility of the precursor.
* **CScore** the final precursor score calculated by Beta-DIA after merging all sub-scores.
* **CScore.PG** the final protein group score calculated by Beta-DIA after merging multiple peptide scores.
